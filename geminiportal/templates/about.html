<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    This site is a full-featured <em>gemini://</em> to <em>https://</em> web proxy service.
    If you haven't heard of <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/">Gemini</a> yet,
    it's a wonderful new protocol inspired by gopher!
</p>
<p>
    This site was launched in August 2019, making it the first public gemini proxy and one of the earliest graphical clients for gemini!
</p>
<h3>design</h3>
<p>
    This site is unapologetically <a href="https://brutalistwebsites.com/">brutalist</a> by design.
</p>
<h3>certificates</h3>
<p>
    All gemini connections are made securely over TLS. This proxy does not attempt to
    validate the TLS certificates for gemini servers, nor will it compare them against any
    previously seen fingerprints (TOFU scheme). The proxied server's x509 certificate can be
    manually inspected by clicking the <a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/mozz.us/?crt=1">[view cert]</a> link at the top of the page.
</p>
<h3>favicons</h3>
<p>
    This proxy provides experimental support for gemini emoji favicons, as outlined in this
    <a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/mozz.us/files/rfc_gemini_favicon.gmi">draft specification</a>.
    If a valid favicon is found, it will be displayed on the left side of the URL bar. Favicons are
    cached per-domain for up to 4 hours.
</p>
<h3>blocking access</h3>
<p>
    This proxy used to honor the gemini
    <a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/companion/robots.gmi">robots.txt</a>
    specification as the <em>webproxy</em> user agent, but support for this was turned off because it posed some
    technical challenges and user adoption was inconsistent and confusing.
</p>
<p>
    If you host content on gemini and you would prefer that it <strong>not</strong> to be accessible through this web proxy
    for whatever reason, please send me an email and I'll add you to the list of blocked hosts. The following
    error message will be displayed for these servers:
</p>
<p>
    <em>This host has kindly requested that their content not be accessed via web proxy.</em>
</p>
