  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>This website is a proxy service that exposes <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/">gemini://</a>
    servers (and other hipster protocols, collectively referred to as the "smolnet") over the web so they can
    be accessed in a normal web browser.</p>
  <p>This is a hobby project that I host on my personal server and maintain in my spare time.</p>
  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>
    This website was originally started in 2019 as a testbed for <em>gemini://</em> client development, and was
    named <b>Gemini Portal</b>. </p>
  <p>
  <p>
    In 2023, there was a full rewrite and the source code was published online for the first time. Later that year,
    support for <em>gopher://</em> was added and the site was renamed to <b>Smolnet Portal</b> to reflect the
    increasing scope of the project.
  </p>
  <h3>Design</h3>
  <p>
    This site is unapologetically <a href="https://brutalistwebsites.com/">brutalist</a> by design.
  </p>
  <h3>GopherVR</h3>
  <p>
    I started working on a modern port of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GopherVR">GopherVR</a>
    using javascript & WebVR.</p>
  <p>Development has stalled, but you can play with the early version by adding <em>?vr=1</em> to
    the end of any gopher URL. E.g. <a href="/gopher/gopher.quux.org/?vr=1">/gopher/gopher.quux.org/?vr=1</a>
  </p>
  <h3>TLS certificates</h3>
  <p>
    All gemini connections are made securely over TLS. This proxy does not attempt to
    validate the TLS certificates for gemini servers, nor will it compare them against any
    previously seen fingerprints (TOFU scheme). The proxied server's x509 certificate can be
    manually inspected by clicking the <a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/mozz.us/?crt=1">[view cert]</a> link at
    the top of the page. </p>
  <h3>Favicons</h3>
  <p>
    This proxy provides experimental support for gemini emoji favicons, as outlined in this
    <a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/mozz.us/files/rfc_gemini_favicon.gmi">draft specification</a>.
    If a valid favicon is found, it will be displayed on the left side of the URL bar. Favicons are
    cached per-domain for up to 4 hours. </p>
  <h3>Blocking Access</h3>
  <p>
    This proxy used to honor the gemini
    <a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/companion/robots.gmi">robots.txt</a>
    specification as the <em>webproxy</em> user agent, but support for this was turned off because it posed some
    technical challenges and user adoption was inconsistent and confusing. </p>
  <p>
    If you host content on gemini and you would prefer that it <strong>not</strong> to be accessible through this web
    proxy
    for whatever reason, please send me an email and I'll add you to the list of blocked hosts. The following
    error message will be displayed for these servers: </p>
  <p>
    <em>This host has kindly requested that their content not be accessed via web proxy.</em>
  </p>
  <h3>RSS Feeds</h3>
  <p>
    You can use this site to convert RSS feeds that are hosted on alternate protocols. Add <i>?raw=1</i>
    to the end of a proxy URL in order to fetch the plain XML file.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Example: <a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/geminiprotocol.net/news/atom.xml?raw=1">https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/geminiprotocol.net/news/atom.xml?raw=1</a></i>
  </p>
  <h3>Proxy Links</h3>
  <p>
    If you have an existing gemini/gopher URL, and you want to create a hyperlink to view it in
    the proxy, you can use the <i>?url=&lt;url&gt;</i> query parameter. This will redirect to
    the canonical proxy URL for the resource.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Example: <a href="https://portal.mozz.us?url=gemini://geminiprotocol.net">https://portal.mozz.us?url=gemini://geminiprotocol.net</a></i>
  </p>
